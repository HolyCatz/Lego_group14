PA1473 - Software Development: Agile Project (Template)
Template information
This template should help your team write a good readme-file for your project. (The file is called
README.md in your project directory.)
You are of course free to add more sections to your readme if you want to.
Readme-files on GitHub are formatted using Markdown. You can find information about how to format
using Markdown here: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-
writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax
Your readme-file should include the following sections:
Introduction
This part should give a general introduction to your project.
Getting started
This section is supposed to guide a new developer through the steps of how to set up the project and
install the deppendencies they need to start developing.
Building and running
This is where you explain how to make the project run. What is your startup procedure? Does the
program accept different arguments to do different things?
You should also describe how to operate your program. Does it need manual input before it starts
picking up and sorting the items?
Features
Lastly, you should write which of the user stories you did and didn't develop in this project, in the form
of a checklist. Like this:
- [x] US_1: As a user I want to...
- [ ] US_2: As a user I want to...
